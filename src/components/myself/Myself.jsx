        <p>I recently started a new journey as web developer, which is now a new passion for me. I knew from way back that web development was a perfect fit for me. I therefore went on taking Le Wagon web development bootcamp, which made me realised that I was not wrong. I enjoy coding beautiful things and the process to bring ideas to life.</p>
